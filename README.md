# Scripts_Mobius_looper
Some Scripts to use with Mobius Looper. https://www.circularlabs.com/
Best looper I've ever used. Unfortunately not maintained anymore.

# Scripts
- Copy -12: copy audio to next track and play at half speed (=> down an octave)
- drone: record, fade in, complete short loop, overdub, fade out, play
- fadeinenout: the name says it already
- Freeze: takes a short bit of audio and keeps repeating it.
- lowDrone: takes a short audio loop and transposes it down
- recovd: use one command to go from record to overdub to play to overdub, long press = reset.
- Reverse-HalfSpeed: short press: reverse/normal, ling press: halfspeed
